Detailed Course Schedule
------------------------

Each week the studio will be split into two parts: Discussion and a hands-on lab. We will begin with a check-in and a review of progress, followed by discussion of the assigned text for the week. After a short break, we'll switch to a hands-on lab. Lab activities will vary each week and depend on projects but include: Learning to use collaborative project tools; project sprints; testing; production of documentation; comparison / evaluation of competing solutions, and so on.

2\. Project Partners
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Meet the co-op partners

This week, potential project partners will join us to present the work they do. After the presentations, everyone will provide their partner preferences in ranked order, with a short explanation of top preferences. Please note that not every potential project partner will necessarily work out, and not every student will be part of their top pick for a project team. We'll do our best to organize project teams to balance team size, skills, and preferences.

{{< tdopen >}}


Catch up on the readings, complete the intake questionnaire (optional). Share this with the project team before the site visit to inform the brainstorm session.

Fill out {{% resource_link 19917b82-fbb9-16da-74d0-d39d32c17d9f "Partner Request Form (PDF)" %}} (not until after the presentations, please!)
